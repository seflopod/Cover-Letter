# Cover Letter
A cover letter I made for a Moonbot Studios application.  This was made using Unity 5.
WebGL build on my [dropbox](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/105401308/cover_letter/index.html).

Made on 05/04/2015 as a cover letter for Moonbot Studios.
As promised, these are the links to the various projects mentioned in the game (listed in no particular order).  Since they are all GitHub repos, you can of course find them by navigating my <a href="https://github.com/seflopod">GitHub page</a>.</p>
 - [fkjs](https://github.com/seflopod/fkjs) - A small engine-like piece of coding that I did while trying to teach myself making games using HTML5 and JavaScript.  The engine portion is somewhat accidental, but I found it valuable as a self-teaching excerise.  There may be something there, but feel I need more experience to tease out whatever that is.
 - [Cubey's Confusion Cube](https://github.com/seflopod/CubeysConfusionCube) - This was originally a project for a Ludem Dare competition.  A playable demo is on my [dropbox](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/105401308/cubey_web/cubey_web.html).
 - [When Things Fall Apart](https://github.com/seflopod/When-Things-Fall-Apart) - A Global Game Jam 2014 game made with Never Time Studios.  I handled all programming except the player movment and object placement.
 - [Games shipped](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Ogre+Toast+Studios) - I include them as a bundle here because it was just easier for the links.  I handled all coding except for bolt behaviors in Sniper Squirrel.  For Jump, I took a prototype and modified the input to work smoothly on both web and mobile platforms but otherwise coded everything myself.
